To see how many orders came within each hour of the work day: : using python list functions and methods

The data, collected from online and in-person orders, includes a set of uniform records, each storing the following fields
• Date and time of the order. The date ranges over all dates of August, 2019. The time range of orders corresponds to the working hours of the business, which is 6 am until midnight.
• First and last name of the person making the order, if known. 'anon' represents orders by anonymous customers.
• Number of items ordered for each of the following products: espresso, cappuccino, americano, pastry, muffin, scone.
The data is supplied in a file, orderlog.py, which is posted with the assignment. For simplicity, orderlog.py contains a definition of a python list, stored in variable called orderlst.
